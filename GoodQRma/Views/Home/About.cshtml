            As you may be aware, many people throw out a good deal of “stuff” when they move.  Unfortunately, a lot of this “stuff” is food that could be delivered to a family in need rather than thrown away.  That’s where we come in ….  Our movers offer to pick up the unwanted, non-perishable food items from those who are moving and deliver it to their local food banks.

        </h2>
        <p > If physically going somewhere as a team is out of the question, volunteering as a team is still possible – if you’re willing to get creative. For instance, you could split your employees into teams and hold a contest for which team can bring in the most toys or canned goods. At the end of the campaign, hold a short – and fun – meeting to announce the winning team. When people are at their true best – not just the way they behave at work – it’s easier for bonding to occur.</pclass>

        <p >Another reason volunteering as a team works is because it forces people who may never have to work together to interact. Since volunteer tasks often involve behind the scenes work, there’s usually plenty of time for your employees to talk. When the people who’ve never exchanged more than a few pleasantries with each other begin to talk, they can find common bonds that will help strengthen your team’s sense of unity.</p>
